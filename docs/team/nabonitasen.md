### Project: TAfinder

TAfinder is a desktop address book application used by SOC professors to choose TAs from a large pool of applicants. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to bookmark/unbookmark users.
    * What it does: allows the user to bookmark/unbookmark specific applicants of their choice, and list all bookmarked applicants.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may want to take special note of certain applicants or may require a way to sigal which applicants have already been chosen to be a TA.
    * Credits: List function later refactored by Amy.

* **New Feature**: Added an initial view command to display a singular applicant.
    * What it does: allows the user to view a singular applicant.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may want to view and evaluate just one applicant's details instead of the whole list.
    * Credits: Later updated by Ravern to display applicant on a separate panel.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=nabonitasen&breakdown=true)
